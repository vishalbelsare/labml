This is an open-source library to push updates of your ML/DL model training to mobile. [Here's a sample experiment](https://app.labml.ai/run/39b03a1e454011ebbaff2b26e3148b3d)

### Notable Features

* **Mobile first design:** web version, that gives you a great mobile experience on a mobile browser.
* **Model Gradients, Activations and Parameters:** Track and compare these indicators independently. We provide a separate analysis for each of the indicator types.
* **Summary and Detail Views:** Summary views would help you to quickly scan and understand your model progress. You can use detail views for more in-depth analysis.
* **Track only what you need:** You can pick and save the indicators that you want to track in the detail view. This would give you a customised summary view where you can focus on specific model indicators.
* **Standard ouptut:** Check the terminal output from your mobile. No need to SSH.

### [ðŸ“š How to track experiments?](https://github.com/labmlai/labml)

### How to run app locally?

Install the PIP package

```sh
pip install labml-app

```

Start the server

```sh
labml app-server
```

Set the web api url to `http://localhost:5005/api/v1/track?` when you run experiments.
You can also [set this on `.labml.yaml`](https://github.com/labmlai/labml/blob/master/guides/labml_yaml_file.md).

```python
from labml import tracker, experiment

with experiment.record(name='sample', token='http://localhost:5005/api/v1/track?'):
    for i in range(50):
        loss, accuracy = train()
        tracker.save(i, {'loss': loss, 'accuracy': accuracy})
```
